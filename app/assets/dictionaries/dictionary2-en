Do you have a problem
Your mother is beautiful
My sister is a little girl
Your dog is a big animal
You are playing with my cat
Thanks for the wonderful gift
The sky is blue
I love my family
You mean the world to me
You are everything to me
You fill my heart
Your house is amazing
I can't live without you
You are the love of my life
Susy and Sandra are in Germany
They save boats from danger
They put out the fire
Argentina is bigger than Puerto Rico
Someday the cat will find a mouse
Your father is a big man
The flowers are red
My friend is a good person
I have long hair
France is amazing
The shoes are ugly
The mouse eats the cheese
The computer is useful
Your brother is lazy
My sister has a boyfriend
My boss is busy
Your cousin is my best friend
That guy is handsome
My friend is stubborn
That girl is famous
The phone is expensive
That dog doesn't drink water
Cindy doesn't have candy
He loves toilet paper
We eat that with cheese
You are unbelievable
What do you want
I am a superhero
